# EPC Clustering adn Sensitivity Analysis

This repository contains a Python script for clustering energy performance data and conducting sensitivity analysis on the clusters.

# How it works

1. The script first loads the dataset and performs an exploratory analysis to understand the data.
2. It then uses a clustering algorithm to group similar data points together.
3. The script then create a regression models of a specific parameter and conducts a sensitivity analysis on the clusters to understand how the clusters change with different parameters.
4. Finally, the script visualizes the results of the sensitivity analysis.

# Installation
```bash
# Set the Python version for the current directory
pyenv local 3.12.6

# Create the Pipenv environment using pyenv
pipenv --python $(pyenv which python)

# Activate the Pipenv environment
pipenv shell

# Install dependencies
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage 
Run the script with the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

# Methods
## Clustering
Top generate the cluseter the K-means algortihm is used. The number of clusters can be determined using the elbow method or silhouette method.
The resulting clusters are saved in the directory specified by the `clusters_output_dir` parameter.

## Modeling
The script then create a regression models of a specific parameter.
The regression models are creted using the best models created from the following algorithms:
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- LightGBM

The best models are selected based on the following metrics:
- RMSE: Root mean square error
- R2: Coefficient of determination
- MAE: Mean absolute error

## Sensitivity Analysis
The script then conducts a sensitivity analysis on the clusters to understand how the clusters change with different parameters.
The sensitivity analysis is conducted using the following methods:
- Scenario Analysis
- What-if Analysis
- Counterfactual Analysis
- Robustness Analysis
- Scenario Analysis

The results of the sensitivity analysis are saved in the directory specified by the `results_dir` parameter.

## Models
The models are saved in the directory specified by the `models_dir` parameter.
- Scenario Analysis

The results of the sensitivity analysis are saved in the directory specified by the `results_dir` parameter.

# Parameters
data_path: Path to the input CSV data file to be loaded as dataframe
columns_selected: Columns to use for clustering
cluster_method_custom: Use custom cluster value instead of statistical method (elbow, silhouette, etc.)
cluster_value: Number of clusters when using custom method
cluster_method_stat: Statistical method for determining cluster count (elbow, silhouette, etc.)
columns_to_delete: Columns to delete from the dataset
save_clusters: Whether to save cluster datasets
clusters_output_dir: Directory to save cluster datasets (default: data/data_cluster)
models_dir: Directory to save models (default: models)
results_dir: Directory to save results (default: results)
